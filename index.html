Content 
- A title of the Website
- a small logo
- a short catch-phrase
- a "comming soon" Message
- a list of app futures
- an eye-catching picture
- a contact link. It can be pointing to mailto:jane_doe@example.com or any fake e-mail.
- a table comparing your features with the competition. Again, it doesn't need to be true data.

Structure
- A header at the top: with the title and a logo.
- A footer at the bottom: with a copyright notice and a contact link.
- A main section in the middle: with picture/s, a description or catching-phrase, "coming soon", list of app features,...


Style

Try to design an attractive style. This may be very personal and the beauty will not be considered, but the page needs to have a custom style. Some things you can do are:

- Write your CSS code in a separate file and link it to the HTML.
- Change the background color or use an image for the background.
- Change the font family. Use different fonts for different sections to highlight them (the title may have a different font than the rest, or the coming soon may be different,...)
- Use text formatting or font sizes to highlight special words you may want to prioritize in your message.
- Give a custom style to your links.
- Define CSS classes to apply the same style to common elements.
- Learn about CSS flex or grid to easily align UI elements.
Not enough?

If you want to do more you can pick some of these add-ons.

- Check a UI framework (Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS or Tailwind). They will help you get a professionally looking style without requiring much front-end knowledge.
  Create two pages instead, a home page and an about page with a full description of the websites features. Add a menu on both pages that lets the user jump from one to the other. Make the menu stand out.
- Once you have finished with your document, add it to GIT, commit it and push it to the remote repository.
