      <p>We're working hard on our new website and app, and we can't wait to share them with you. In the meantime,
        here's a sneak peek at some of the features you can expect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Feature 1: Smart warehousing: This warehouse uses robots to pick and pack goods, which increases efficiency
          and reduces the risk of errors.</li>
        <li>Feature 2: Green warehousing: This warehouse uses solar panels to generate its own electricity and recycles
          all of its waste.</li>
        <li>Feature 3: Fulfillment warehousing: This warehouse offers a complete range of services, from picking and
          packing goods to shipping them to customers.</li>
